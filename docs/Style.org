* What am I?
  This document is a general outline of the style of the directory
  structure as well as the coding style that is expected.

* Coding Style
** Magic Numbers
** Statements
** Methods

** Files
  - Project.tex: Project Documentation (.tex form)
  - Project.bib: Project Documentation Sources
  - Project.pdf: *Official* Project Documentation
  - Style.org:   (You Are Here!)
** Sub-Directories
*** data
    We don't have any data, but if we did, it would go here.
*** diagrams
    No one looks here, so don't worry.
**** Files
- Diagrams_Guide.org: Useless. Does it even exist?
**** Sub-Directories
***** src
      Arbitrary decision to place files that are used to make images, but not
      themselves images, go here.
***** out
      See above.
