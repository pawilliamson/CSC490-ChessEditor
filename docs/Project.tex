% Section 1 - Project Definition (Group Responsibility)
\section{Project Definition}
People like Chess and need a way to quickly develop and practice new strategies. I love
Chess!!! Chess Editor will let people play Chess on their PC and set up the board the
way they want to test different strategies, or just play in a different way. It will support
playing against an AI, or playing against another person locally. It will include an account
system to track wins and losses. For the purposes of testing, there will be an undo and
redo button, as well as tools to set up specific board scenarios. It will be programmed in
Java and we will use Stockfish for the AI.

% Section 2 - Project Requirements (Group Responsibility)
\section{Project Requirements}

\subsection{Functional Requirments}

\subsubsection{Primary Requirements}
The primary requirements of the project must be functional at 'all times'. These requirements include the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item User can play a local game of chess.
\end{enumerate}

% Removing: \item The user is able to add a chess engine\footnote{Whether the chess engine works is dependent on the engine. However at least two public chess engines must work with the application.}

\subsubsection{Secondary Requirements}
The secondary requirements of the project may not always be function and are dependent on specific situation. These requirements include the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item User can play a game of chess remotely.
\item User can use program to analyze moves.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Usability}
\subsubsection{User Interface}
The user interface must not be obtrusive and intuitive. Visuals need to be properly contrasted for differentiation. 
\subsubsection{Performance}
The program must be able to perform without noticable performance drop in all situations with the exceptional of analysis and secondary features.
\subsection{System}
\subsubsection{Hardware}
\paragraph{Serverside}

\paragraph{Clientside}
The required hardware is a standard personal computer with a monitor display.
\subsubsection{Software}
\paragraph{Required Software}
A modern web browser will be required to use the application.
\paragraph{Operating System}
This project will primarily be a web application, so it will not be specific to any operating system in particular. The browser used however, may impact the application.
\subsubsection{Database}
This project wi
% Please ellaborate  MySQL (Which Version?)
\subsubsection{Networking}
Certain secondary functionality requires a network connection in order to work properly.
% Online chess
\subsection{Security}
User authentication to create and join online games.

% Section 3  Project Specification (Group Responsibility)
\section{Project Specification}
\subsection{Scope}
This project will work to develop a chess web application similiar to lichess to develop the following skills:
\begin{itemize}
\item Working with Angular
\item WOrking with remote distribution platform
\end{itemize}
The web application should be able to run a game of chess between two players.
\subsection{Libraries/ Frameworks/ Development Environments/ Dependencies}
This project will be developed using Angular Framework
\subsection{Platform}
This project will be a web application that can be accessed by a web browser.
\subsection{Genre}
This project is can be considered as a video game or an online game depending on the context.

\subsection{Sprint 1}
Sprint 1 began on January 22, 2021 and continued till Febuary 6, 2021. The period lasted one (1) day longer than its assigned duration.
\subsubsection{Scrums}
During the sprint, two scrum meetings took place:
\begin{itemize}
 \item January 28, 2021: Discussed the framework of the project and decided to use Angular. Also discussed the scope of the project, decided to make it a web application. Mention of authetication services for server.
\item Febuary 4, 2021: Discussed some work that was done since the previous scrum;  includes diagrams and investigation of Google Authentication for the server.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Subsystem 1: Chess Game}
\subsubsection{Initial Design and Models}
The idea is to make this subsystem efficient and open so we can potentially add or reuse different components for the editor or analysis functionality. This will be reused for online games, so it would be best for this to be modular.
