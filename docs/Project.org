#+TITLE: Chess Editor
#+TAGS: @DeMO @pizzaza @Tyler @Dakota @pawilliamson
* Project Definition
People like Chess and need a way to quickly develop and practice new strategies. I love
Chess!!! Chess Editor will let people play Chess on their PC and set up the board the
way they want to test different strategies, or just play in a different way. It will support
playing against an AI, or playing against another person locally. It will include an account
system to track wins and losses. For the purposes of testing, there will be an undo and
redo button, as well as tools to set up specific board scenarios. It will be programmed in
Typescript and we will use Stockfish for the AI.

*** Sequence Diagram                                                  :@DeMO:
    :WHY:
    I have previously made the sequence diagram, but I have had to redo it a couple times
    as we have continued, the design has changed. I am going to just upload an complete 
    sequence diagram and since it doesn't have to be the same and can be used in refinement
    section.
