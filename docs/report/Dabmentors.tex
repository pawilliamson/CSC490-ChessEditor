	\section{Project Definition}
	Chess is a classic game that has been played by millions since its conception; be it as a board game or in modern times as a digital game. It is a game that has relatively simple rules that make it a game that has been a standard for testing the computation ability of automata. Although they have become advanced enough where chess is no longer sufficient\footnote{https://openai.com/projects/five/}, we feel it is a good start for testing ones' abilities. The goal of this project is to develop a chess application using the Angular framework and to test some concepts that we are interested in, such as User Authentication with Google Identity and the Unified Chess Interface\footnote{Current development has this pending, may have to change.}  with an added bonus of trying to wrangle with an external web server for multi-player support.
