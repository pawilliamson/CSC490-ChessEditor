*** Conceptual Docs
I have several markdown strewn around on my computer that I need to
compile down and utilize. I think what I had 
*** Explanation of project.
I have been considering what we are doing is
not actually a chess editor, but a chess client with a scenario editor
(+ chess server).
** Designs
I haven't actually talked about my the design docs with the team yet because I hadn't finished yet.
*** Game System
**** Game
Contains information about the game as a whole, anything related to an instance of a game.
***** Move 

***** Board
Object containing all the positions on the board
****** Cells
******* Position
******* Padding
******* Margin
******* Border
******* Content
**** Piece
***** Type
***** Side
***** Moves
**** Player
***** Moves


** Project Tracking
*** ZenHub
I wouldn't be calling this an acheivement considering how bad I have
it, but issues for the first sprint (we stll have task listed under
the first sprint).
Q: Should I keep it like that or change it?
*** TODO Roadmap
    SCHEDULED: <2021-02-05 Fri>
IMPORT THE BLODDY THING!
I tried to estimate where we should be at what time, I still have a
ways to go.
** General
*** Angular
I have been trying to learn how to use Angular. I haven't had much
free-time so I haven't gotten far. The only **contribution** I made
was adding some template json files since I couldn't build the main
branch, and I made a mistake when I uploaded the instructions to
build.
~npm install~ vs ~npm install ChessEditor~


* Next Week
** Finish Diagrams
   DEADLINE: <2021-02-05 Fri 23:00>

   Well finish the diagrams that I am working on. Someone has their own diagrams
   so I will just be focusing on the sequence, component, and roadmap diagrams.

   :NOTE:
   I failed to do that.
