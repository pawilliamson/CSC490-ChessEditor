# CSC490-ChessEditor Readme

## Requirements
npm: 6.14.11

## How to build?
This project requires node to build the projects and download the dependencies.

The steps below outline the process that allows you to use your GitHub root directory in tandem with the installation resources.

Please make sure that the GitHub repository is downloaded **before** proceeding with this step.

Use the following commands in this order:
1. Create your project using the GitHub repo directory.
    -**Note:** Depending on your IDE, it may be more appropriate to import a project from the GitHub repo. I had to use Import Angular Project for Eclipse with Angular IDE extension.

2. `cd [Your project directory]` 

    - The directory in which the npm package will be installed for server rendering.

    - **Example:** `cd C:\Users\Preston.Williamson\eclipse-workspace\CSC490-ProjectDirectory`

3. `npm install`
    
    - Install step

4. `ng serve --open`

    - Command given to start the server.
    
    - **Note:** Depending on IDE and project configurations, this may already be done for you. Eclipse provides a UI option to start the server with Anguler IDE extension.
